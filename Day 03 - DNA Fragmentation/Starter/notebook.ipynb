During the outbreak, a group of researchers obtained virus samples from 78 patients, sequenced and assembled the Ebola virus genomes from these samples, and used the genome sequences to identify the origin of the outbreak ([Gire et al. 2014](http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6202\/1369.long)).
